# TinyRcon

TinyRcon is a simple, easy to use GUI application that I have developed using the C++ programming language (C++ 17 and C++ 20 standards), the Win32 API and the standalone Asio C++ networking library. 
It can be used by game server administrators to manage their game servers through the game server's own rcon interface (which must be based on the Q3 engine's rcon protocol). 
It is currently under active development. Unfortunately, due to the fact that I have extensively used the Win32 API for developing the GUI part of the application, thus it is not a cross-platform graphical application at the moment.
I plan to to make it cross-platform in the near future.
