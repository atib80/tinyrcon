# TinyRcon

TinyRcon is a relatively simplistic, easy to use GUI application developed using the C++ programming language, the Win32 API and the standalone Asio C++ networking library. 
It is currently under active development and it is not a cross-platform GUI application at the moment. 
I plan to to make it cross-platform shortly.
